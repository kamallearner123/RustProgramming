BPF is a virtual machine that allows user defined programs in kernel when certain events happen on linux system.
Ex: You want to monitor suspicious file activity, log n/w response latency.

Options to write the code:
========================
1) bpftrace
2) C code 

Compile with BCC.

- BPFTRACE is a tool to write the program.
- BCC is better suited for more complex tools, when integrating with other applications and systems.

C code ----> clang to BPF byte code (Can be executed in BPF VM in kernel.


An example of BPFTRACE:
======================
# bpftrace -e 'kprobe:vfs_read /pid == 30153/ { @start[tid] = nsecs; }
kretprobe:vfs_read /@start[tid]/ { @ns = hist(nsecs - @start[tid]); delete(@start[tid]); }'
